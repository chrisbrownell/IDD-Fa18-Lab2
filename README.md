Chris Brownell (ckb77)

## Part A. Solder your LCD panel

**Take a picture of your soldered panel and add it here!**

## Part B. Writing to the LCD
 
**a. What voltage level do you need to power your display?**

5.0V +/- 0.2V

**b. What voltage level do you need to power the display backlight?**

3.2V +/- 0.15V
   
**c. What was one mistake you made when wiring up the display? How did you fix it?**

**d. What line of code do you need to change to make it flash your name instead of "Hello World"?**
 
**e. Include a copy of your Lowly Multimeter code in your lab write-up.**


## Part C. Using a time-based digital sensor

**Upload a video of your working rotary encoder here.**


## Part D. Make your Arduino sing!

**a. How would you change the code to make the song play twice as fast?**
 
**b. What song is playing?**


## Part E. Make your own timer
